> Reproduction date: 2024-08-08.

This respository can be used with this [bilibili video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV18S411N7iR/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0&vd_source=e2b96538b3c2da2818bba0c80e8491e2). When you have a lesson and the demostrated code of video runs into problems, open the corresponding file under `notebook` folder and you will find the right code. The code should work since I've tried out, but if you run into problems and are willing to fix them, feel free to submit a pull request.

> 这个仓库可以配套[bilibili 视频](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV18S411N7iR/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0&vd_source=e2b96538b3c2da2818bba0c80e8491e2)使用，但这个视频里存在代码错误影响运行。当你上到某一节课，代码运行遇到问题时，打开notebook文件夹下对应的文件即可对照修正。本仓库的代码应该可以运行，但如果遇到问题，并且你愿意修正，欢迎提交pull request。

In case that you are interested in the complete implementation of the transformer model, please open the transformer folder and you will find it. However, I suggest you go to the [transformer](https://github.com/Kyubyong/transformer) for a more complete implementation.
